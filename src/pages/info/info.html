      The IEEE Sri Lanka Section, for the sixth consecutive year, is getting ready to present the Sri Lankan IEEE
      enthusiasts with yet another memorable episode of the Sri Lanka Section Student / Young Professional / Women
      in Engineering Congress for the year of 2017. This is undoubtedly the most awaited event of the IEEE Sri Lanka
      Section where Student Branches,Young Professionals and Women in Engineering share their achievements to receive
      public endorsement and inspire others. Starting in 2012, it has been a long journey in bringing the congress to
      the stratum it enjoys today and the section expects to reap more and more with each year. This year the congress
      is themed on “VISION BEYOND TECHNOLOGY” and IEEE SLSYWC’17 will consist of various interesting sessions to
      facilitate the theme.
